# Kubernetes monitoring and alerting in less than 5 minutes

Kubelet natively exposes cadvisor metrics at https://kubernetes.default.svc:443/api/v1/nodes/{node-name}/proxy/metrics/cadvisor and we can use a prometheus server to scrape this endpoint. These metrics can then be visualized using Grafana. Metrics can alse be scraped from pods and service endpoints if they expose metircs on /metrics (as in the case of nginx-ingress-controller), alternatively you can sepcify custom scrape target in the prometheus config map. 

Some Important metrics which are not exposed by the kubelet, can be fetched using kube-state-metrics and then pulled by prometheus.

The Prometheus Pushgateway exists to allow ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway. The Pushgateway then exposes these metrics to Prometheus. 

## Standalone Prometheus Setup:

1. If you have not already deployed the nginx-ingress controller then
    - Uncomment `type: LoadBalancer` field in Alertmanager, Prometheus and Grafana Services.
2. Deployment: 
    - Deploy Alertmanger: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/alertmanager`
    - Deploy Prometheus: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/prometheus`
    - Deploy Kube-state-metrics: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/kube-state-metrics`
    - Deploy Node-Exporter: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/node-exporter`
    - Deploy Grafana: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/grafana`
    - Deploy Pushgateway: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/pushgateway`

3. Once grafana is running:
    - Access grafana at `grafana.yourdomain.com` in case of Ingress or http://<LB-IP>:3000 in case of type: LoadBalancer
    - Add DataSource: 
      - Name: DS_PROMETHEUS - Type: Prometheus 
      - URL: `http://prometheus-service:8080` 
      - Save and Test. You can now build your custon dashboards or simply import dashboards from grafana.net. Dashboard #315 and #1471 are good to start with.
      - You can also import the dashboards from `k8s/monitoring/dashboards`

### Note:

1. A Cluster-binding role for prometheus is already being created by the config. The role currently has admin permissions, however you can modify it to a viewer role only.
2. if you need to update the prometheus config, it can be reloaded by making an api call to the prometheus server. `curl -XPOST http://<prom-service>:<prom-port>/-/reload`
3. Some basic alerting rules are defined in the prometheus rules file which can be updated before deploying. You can also add more rules under the same groups or create new ones. 
4. Before deploying prometheus please create GCP PD-SSD or AWS EBS Volume of size 250Gi or more, and name it `pd-ssd-disk-01`.
5. Please update `00-alertmanager-configmap.yaml` to reflect correct api_url for Slack and VictorOps. You can additionally add more receievers. Ref:  https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/ 

## Highly Available and Scalable Clustered Prometheus Setup Using Thanos:

1. It is highly recommended to deploy an ingress-controller in order to reduce the number of endpoints created. This set-up uses Nginx Ingress Controller.

2. This set-up uses a GCS bucket as long term storage for prometheus data, to which it will be uploaded and compacted by Thanos. In order to configure that
    - Create 2 GCS buckets and name them as `prometheus-long-term` and `thanos-ruler`
    - Create a service account with the roles as Storage Object Creator and Storage Object Viewer
    - Download the key file as json credentials and name it as `thanos-gcs-credentials.json`
    - Create kubernetes secret using the credentials, `kubectl create secret generic thanos-gcs-credentials --from-file=thanos-gcs-credentials.json -n monitoring`

3. Deployment: 
    - Deploy Alertmanger: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/alertmanager`
    - Deploy Prometheus: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/prometheus-ha`. This will deploy Prometheus and Thanos Stateful sets. The required volumes are provisioned dynamically. 
    - Deploy Kube-state-metrics: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/kube-state-metrics`
    - Deploy Node-Exporter: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/node-exporter`
    - Deploy Grafana: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/grafana`. Storage volume is provisioned dynamically.
    - Deploy Pushgateway: `kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring/pushgateway`

4. Once grafana is running:
    - Access grafana at `grafana.yourdomain.com`
    - Add DataSource: 
      - Name: `DS_Prometheus` 
      - URL: `http://thanos-querier:9090` 
      - Save and Test. You can now build your custon dashboards or simply import dashboards from grafana.net. Dashboard #315 and #1471 are good to start with.
      - You can also import the dashboards from `k8s/monitoring/dashboards-ha`

5. You can access 
    - Each prometheus replica at `prometheus-0.yourdomain.com`, `prometheus-1.yourdomain.com` and `prometheus-2.yourdomain.com`
    - Thanos-querier with de-deuplicated data at `thanos-querier.yourdomain.com`
    - Thanos-ruler at `thanos-ruler.yourdomain.com`
    - Alermanager at `alertmanager.yourdomain.com`

### Note:

1. Whenever prometheus config map is updated thanos automatically reloads all prometheus servers so no manual update needed. 
2. Some basic alerting rules are defined in the prometheus rules file which can be updated before deploying. You can also add more rules under the same groups or create new ones.
3. Please update alertmanager config map with appropriate alert delivery endpoints. 
4. Instead of GCS as long term storage you can also use S3. Refer prometheus docs for the config change.
